### ðŸŽ“ [Project 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/)
- Mail: Built the front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails.
- I wrote all the front-end code in this repository. The RESTful API in the backend was given by the instructor.

## ðŸ’¡Lessons Learned
- Using vanilla Javascript to build the front-end of a single-page web application
- Using Javascript `fetch` to make API calls to a Django RESTful API
